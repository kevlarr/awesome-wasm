> If you’re into Rust, you’re quite in luck because the Rust core team has really doubled down on WebAssembly. There’s even a dedicated Working Group to improve the experience. You’ll want to check out their Rust+Wasm book.

> WebAssembly is a language for a conceptual machine that’s the least common denominator of the popular real world hardware. When the browser downloads the WebAssembly code it can quickly turn it to any machine’s assembly
> Figma is an interface design tool that runs in the browser and allows designers to easily collaborate and share their work. It’s mostly written in C++ and has a 2D WebGL rendering engine that can handle very large documents. Initially they were using asm.js to compile their C++ code for the web. By switching to WebAssembly, their load time improved by more than 3x regardless of document size.
